# toDo
A To Do list created using vanilla JS + a few font awesome icons

The Font Awesome Directory is not mine! You can find it at this URL: http://fontawesome.io/


This isn't a complete site. I'm currently working on:

1. Edit Button Functionality
  I'm considering having it bring up a modal with input fields to change the taks title and add a task description.
  Another idea would be to cover the task pane with a new div that is focused only on input fields and an enter/cancel button.

2. overall animations for the site
 I need to animate the tasks being deleted/moved. Most likely this will be a 'scale-in/out' effect.
 Another option is an opacity fade which would be easier for me.
 

Feel free to use this code but don't worry about posting changes/advice! The code is very unorganized and I'll most likely never re-factor the js. This is my first function website and my first upload to github!

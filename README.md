# toDo
A To Do list created using vanilla JS + a few font awesome icons

Font Awesome Local Storage removed, now using CDN

Edit Task functionality has been implemeneted (oct 9 17)

This isn't a complete site. I'm currently working on:

1. overall animations for the site
 I need to animate the tasks being deleted/moved. Most likely this will be a 'scale-in/out' effect.
 Another option is an opacity fade which would be easier for me.
 

Feel free to use this code but don't worry about posting changes/advice! I'm still learning and I'd rather figure this out on my own. The code is very unorganized and I'll most likely never re-factor the js. This is my first function website and my first upload to github!

This project is most likely finsished and will no longer be updated. I've got all the functionality necessary for a To Do List app and everything functions correctly.

Working on this project has greatly helped me understand DOM manipulation. Realizing I can now find specific elements anywhere in the document has me feeling very accomplished. I know that my implementation of most of the JS functionality isn't the best but that fact that it works AND I understand it is amazing

I'm excited for my future in web development and I can't wait to work on my next project. I'm considering doing another To Do List but I'll most likely be making a few more single page apps. My main focus is to get much better at JS.
